Adds a markdown editor component to Laravel Nova. Based on [easymde](https://easymde.tk). 

## Installation instructions

Require `dinandmentink/nova-markdown` using composer:

```bash
composer require dinandmentink/nova-markdown
```

The package will register itself using Laravels' package autodiscovery. Now, whenever you want to use a Markdown field use `Markdown::make` like you would expect in the `fields()` method of a Nova resource.

```php
use DinandMentink\Markdown\Markdown;

public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        Markdown::make("Field Name"),
    ];
}
```

It will accept all default Nova options:

```php
use DinandMentink\Markdown\Markdown;

public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        Markdown::make("Content")->rules('required')->hideFromIndex(),
    ];
}
```

## Image uploads
Nova Markdown supports inline image uploads. To upload an image you can drag-and-drop it onto the markdown editor. Alternatively, pasting an image from your clipboard will also work. 

Image upload is enabled by default for all `Markdown` fields. It can be disabled entirely, or by default, through the config. Image upload can be enabled or disabled on a per-field basis, but this will *only* toggle the frontend implementation of image uploads. 

```php
use DinandMentink\Markdown\Markdown;

public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        Markdown::make("Field With Uploads")->uploads(),
        Markdown::make("Field Without Uploads")->uploads(false),
    ];
}
```

Image upload should just workâ„¢. Nova Markdown aims to support image uploads on a vanilla laravel + nova project. The following assumptions must be met. It's possible to override most of these through the config.

- A disk named `public` is assumed to be configured in `filesystems.php`.
- Nova Markdown uses [spatie/image](https://github.com/spatie/image) for compressing and resizing images. Image requires the php [exif extension](http://php.net/manual/en/exif.installation.php) to be enabled.
- Nova Markdown registers a route and a controller in the same middleware configured in `nova.middleware`. This assumes an authenticated user that may access Nova may also post images Nova Markdown's image upload route.

## Difference with Nova's own markdown

Nova, ofcourse, offers it's own [markdown field](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/1.0/resources/fields.html#markdown-field). Nova's official markdown and this, Nova Markdown, are similar. Both of them offer inline text highlighting of markdown text. Both of them perform no transformations on the input and simply store it as plain text, usually in a TEXT column. 

This package however will add some more highlighting and toolbar buttons that are not included the default Markdown field. But mainly, **Nova Markdown handles image uploads**.
